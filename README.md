# Learning-of-Inverse-Kinematics-of-Baxter-Robot-using-Deep-Learning
We tried to learn the pattern for solving the problem of non uniqueness in the solution of a inverse kinematics solution. A network with the LSTM neurons is preferred to perform the task.

The available code is for learning the inverse dynamics model for Baxter Robot. Forward dynamics is used to prepare dataset by using the recording of joint angle to draw a trajectory.
